abstract: "Access to neurological care for Parkinson disease (PD) is a rare privilege for millions of people worldwide, especially in resource-limited countries. In 2013, there were just 1200 neurologists in India for a population of 1.3 billion people; in Africa, the average population per neurologist exceeds 3.3 million people. In contrast, 60,000 people receive a diagnosis of PD every year in the United States alone, and similar patterns of rising PD cases can be seen worldwide. In this paper, we propose a web-based framework that can help anyone anywhere around the world record a short speech task and analyze the recorded data to screen for PD."
