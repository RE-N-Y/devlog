## Overview

Over the recent years, there have been multiple datasets in anime illustration generation space.
Most of them are small-scale, and the largest one is [Danbooru dataset](https://gwern.net/danbooru2021) with ~5M images.
Gwern has put a lot of effort into cleaning and annotating the dataset. He also created a subset of 512px portrait images.
The only issue is that the dataset only contains 300K images and many images contain black frames around the image to ensure 512px size.
Another good exisitng dataset is 90K images from [safebooru](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scribbless/another-anime-face-dataset) on Kaggle.
The dataset quality is execellent, but lacks in size. Pixiv is a good source of anime illustrations.
Steven Evan was kind enough to share his [Pixiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenevan99/face-of-pixiv-top-daily-illustration-2020) on Kaggle.
The dataset consists of top ranking pixiv images from 2018 ~ 2020. However, the faces dataset suffers from low resolution and the faces are too tightly cropped for my taste.

## Creating Animefaces 2M dataset

For that reason, I decided to create a large-scale anime faces dataset from these datasets.

### Removing problematic images

The largest source of anime illustrations is Gwern's danbooru dataset. Thanks to kind people in the internet, the dataset contains many NSFW images.
Thankfully, danbooru dataset has a tag system that allows us to filter out NSFW images. Howevoer, there are plenty of other undesirable images. To list a few:

- CG 3D images
- Manga / Comic
- Furries
- Male images
- Low resolution images
- Cosplay images
